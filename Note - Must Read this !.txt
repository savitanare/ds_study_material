How This KIT Was Created
=========================

1. I conducted thorough research across various platforms to gather authentic and reliable interview experiences.
2. I personally connected with software engineers who recently switched companies to capture genuine, first-hand insights into their interview processes.
3. I also compensated individuals for sharing their real-time interview experiences to ensure the content’s accuracy and value.

Strict Usage Guidelines
========================

- Do NOT post this PDF on LinkedIn or any other platform.
- Do NOT sell or distribute this KIT as if it is your own, whether on Topmate or any other marketplace.
- This KIT is a personal creation; no one has the right to copy, share, or sell it without explicit permission.


Zero-Tolerance Policy for Unauthorized Distribution
===================================================

If I discover anyone selling or sharing this KIT without permission, there will be no warning. 

I will take the following actions:

- Create a dedicated LinkedIn post exposing the individual.
- Include your profile photo in the post.
- Tag you and mention your name.
- Publicly disclose the company you work for.
- Attach screenshots showing how my content was copied and resold.
- This action will result in severe damage to your reputation within the data engineering community.

I sincerely request everyone to respect the hard work that went into creating this KIT. Please do not misuse it.

Unfortunately, my previous KIT was copied and sold by multiple individuals. I do not want to repeat that experience.

Thank you for your cooperation and integrity.
